## How to run
Just clone the repo and open the `index.html` file in any browser. The simulator is also hosted [here](https://theviking733n.github.io/RISC-V-Simulator/). Then go to choose mc file and select any of the mc files in the `tests` folder. Then click on the `Run` / `Step` button to run the simulator. There is a `Statistics` column on the right side which shows the number of instructions executed, number of cycles, CPI, etc.
